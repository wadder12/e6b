# E6B Calculator Project Todo List

## Features to Add

- [ ] Implement input validation to handle invalid or missing input values.
- [ ] Add error handling to display appropriate error messages.
- [ ] Include unit conversion options for airspeed, distance, and fuel rate.
- [ ] Allow user to choose different units of measurement (e.g., knots, miles, liters).
- [ ] Implement a history feature to store and display previous calculations.
- [ ] Create a settings menu to customize the calculator's appearance and behavior.
- [ ] Add a progress bar to indicate the animation progress during calculation.
- [ ] Include a help button or menu to provide instructions on using the calculator.
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for improved usability.

#Code Enhancements

- [ ] Refactor the code to improve modularity and readability.
- [ ] Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code.
- [ ] Apply consistent naming conventions and formatting style throughout the code.
- [ ] Optimize performance by minimizing redundant calculations or unnecessary operations.
- [ ] Improve error handling and exception catching for robustness.
- [ ] Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of the calculations.
- [ ] Consider implementing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for better separation of concerns.
- [ ] Explore using a GUI library other than Tkinter for a more modern and customizable interface.

## Documentation
