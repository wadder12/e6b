## Description

This is the initial release of the E6B Calculator project. The calculator provides basic functionality to perform calculations related to flight planning and navigation. Users can input airspeed, distance, fuel consumption rate, altitude, fuel capacity, and initial fuel quantity. The calculator then animates the calculation process and displays the result in an output label.

## Features in Version 1.0.0

1. **Airspeed input:** Users can enter the airspeed in knots.
2. **Distance input:** Users can enter the distance in nautical miles.
3. **Fuel rate scale:** Provides a slider to select the fuel consumption rate in gallons per hour.
4. **Altitude input:** Users can enter the altitude.
5. **Fuel capacity input:** Users can enter the fuel capacity in gallons.
6. **Initial fuel input:** Users can enter the initial fuel quantity in gallons.
7. **Calculate button:** Initiates the calculation and displays the result.
8. **Result output:** Displays the calculated result in an animated manner.

## Future Development

Future versions of the E6B Calculator will include additional features such as:

- **Input validation:** Handle invalid or missing input values.
- **Error handling:** Display appropriate error messages.
- **Unit conversion options:** Convert airspeed, distance, and fuel rate between different units of measurement.
- **History tracking:** Store and display previous calculations for reference.
- **Customizable settings:** Allow users to modify the calculator's appearance and behavior.
- **Improved user interface:** Enhance visuals and user experience for better usability.
- **Performance optimizations:** Optimize calculations for improved efficiency.
- **Documentation updates:** Provide comprehensive instructions and explanations.
- **Unit tests:** Ensure accuracy and reliability of calculations through automated tests.
- **User feedback and testing:** Incorporate user suggestions and conduct testing for further improvements.

Stay tuned for the upcoming releases as we continue to enhance the E6B Calculator based on user feedback and requirements.
